                                        <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>Communication is considered the key element in any successful business. It is essential to have all branches of your organisation regularly stay connected with each other to streamline the workflow. When it comes to creating an interconnected network, routing and switching are the two sharpest arrows in your quiver. </li>
                                        <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>A switch is what connects every device to facilitate data transfer. It connects computers, servers, printers and other devices. So, the available resources can be shared optimally. The connected devices via a switch can interchange information among each other regardless of their geographical location.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>A router is what connects multiple switches. If switches create several small independent networks, routing combines all those individual networks to form an even more extensive network over a large area. In addition to connecting several switches over multiple locations, a router also enables the connected devices to access the internet. </li>

The greater the number of devices, the greater is the threat of data tampering. Instead of ensuring cybersecurity for each node in the network, it is far more efficient to provide well-rounded network security by treating the network as a whole rather than being divided into several components.
